Hi.  

I am Naresh, and this is my personal blog. I am a developer, writer and designer, aiming to bring the best of these 3 worlds together through Computer Science. I enjoy programming and listening to music.

Maybe we can debate on the need for such a long moniker for the blog some other time, but in the meanwhile, do check out some of my posts. Have a great day :smile:!
